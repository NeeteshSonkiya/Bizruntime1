Humanity can be defined as quality of being human; the peculiar nature of man, 
by which he is distinguished from other beings. Being human does not mean that 
an individual possesses humanity.

If you want to understand the quality of humanity in an individual take note of 
what he does for people who give noting back in return to the favour they have 
offered.

One of the most outstanding examples of extra- ordinary humanity in a human 
being has been portrayed beautifully by Mother Teresa. Humanity means caring for 
and helping others whenever and wherever possible. Humanity means helping others 
at times when they need that help the most, humanity means forgetting your 
selfish interests at times when others need your help.
