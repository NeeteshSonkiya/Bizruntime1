    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>

        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

        Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.

        12. TakeUntil - Get values until youâ€™re told not to

    var interval = Rx.Observable.interval(500)
    var notifier = Rx.Observable.timer(2000)

    interval
     .takeUntil(notifier)
     .finally(()=> console.log('Complete!'))
     .subscribe(i => console.log(i))
