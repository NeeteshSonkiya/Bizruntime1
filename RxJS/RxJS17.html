    <h1>Example of mouse event</h1>
    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>
    <p>
        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

        Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.

        4. Hot vs Cold Observables
        This is somewhat confusing topic that should be really simple. Check out Ben Leshâ€™s post on Hot vs. Cold Observables on Medium
        
        Cold Observables start emitting or creating values only when the subscription starts, like a typical YouTube video. Each subscriber will see the same sequence (or pattern) of events from start to finish.
        Hot Observables are always being updated with new values, like a live stream on YouTube. When you subscribe you start with the most recent value and only see future changes.
        Cold Observable Example
        We know an Observable is cold if we subscribe at the same time, but get a different value.</p>
</body>

<script>
var cold = Rx.Observable.create((observer) => {
    observer.next(Math.random())
});
cold.subscribe(a => console.log(`Subcriber A: ${a}`))
cold.subscribe(b => console.log(`Subcriber B: ${b}`))
