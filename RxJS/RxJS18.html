        Hot Observable Example
A hot observable gets its values from an outside source. We can make it hot by simply moving the random number outside of the observable creation function.

<script>
   var x = Math.random()

   var hot = Rx.Observable.create(observer => {
       observer.next(x)
   });
   hot.subscribe(a => console.log(`Subscriber A: ${a}`))
   hot.subscribe(b => console.log(`Subscriber B: ${b}`))
