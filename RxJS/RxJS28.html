    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery
        will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>
    <p>
        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Both Google
        and Microsoft host jQuery.

    <p>11. SwitchMap - Get value from Observable A, then emit Observable B
        switchMap is commonly required when dealing with async data from a database or API call. For example, you need to get a user ID from an observable, then use it to query the database. In this example, we reset an interval after each mouse click.
