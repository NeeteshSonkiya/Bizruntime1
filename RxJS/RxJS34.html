    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery
        will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>

        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Both Google
        and Microsoft host jQuery.

        18. Retry - Never give up
        Let’s say we get an error from an API on the initial request - it might just be a fluke. Let’s give it a couple more tries before we give up and complete the Observable.
        
        The basic retry() operator will try right away as many times as you want.
