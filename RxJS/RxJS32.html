    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery
        will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>

        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Both Google
        and Microsoft host jQuery.

        16. ForkJoin - Merge, wait for completion, emit last values together
I think people like forkJoin() because of it’s cool name, but it seems to confuse people and shows up on StackOverflow way more than it should. It’s similar to zip(), but it waits for all observables to complete then emits only the last values together.

  var yin = Rx.Observable.of('peanut butter', 'wine', 'rainbows')
  var yang = Rx.Observable.of('jelly', 'cheese', 'unicorns')

  yang = yang.delay(1000)

  var combo = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(yin, yang)

  combo.subscribe(arr => console.log(arr))
