        9. Debounce and Throttle - Handle Stream Overload
        Sometimes you might be dealing with a stream that that is emitting values crazy fast - such as mouse move events in the browser. You might only want to handle these events every so often.
        
        Throttle - Give me the first value, then wait X time.
        Debounce - Wait X time, then give me the last value.

// MouseEvent<data>
// wait 1 second...


mouseEvents
  .debounceTime(2000)
