    <p>1. What is RxJS?
            There are different ways to think about RxJS depending on your background. To me, RxJs is …
            
            … a utility for handling asynchronous data streams.
            
            … just like functional vanilla JavaScript in many ways, but with the dimension of time added.
            
            … like a Promise that can resolve over and over again.
            
            I like to think of RxJS terminology in a highly simplified way.
            
            Observable - An array that is built over time.
            Subscription - A for loop that happens over time.
            Emit - When an Observable spits out a value because something subscribed to it.
            Operator - Functions that alter the the way Observables emit values.</p>

    const observable = Rx.Observable.create( observer => {
        observer.next('Welcome')
        observer.next('cyber')
    })
    observable.subscribe( val => console.log(val))
    observable.subscribe( val => console.log(val))
