        5. Map - Control the Emitted Values
        The single most powerful RxJS operator is map. It allows you to modify the emitted values based any logic you desire. It’s the chef’s knife of RxJS operators - you will use it often.
        
        Here we have an observable of numbers, let’s map them to their logarithm  </p>
</body>

<script>
  var numbers = Rx.Observable.from([10, 100, 1000]);
  numbers
    .map(num => Math.log(num))
    .subscribe(x => document.write(x))

/*
    apiCall
    .map(json => JSON.parse(json))
    .subscribe()
*/
</script>
