    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery
        will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>
    <p>
        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Both Google
        and Microsoft host jQuery.
