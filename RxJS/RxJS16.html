        3. Unsubscribe - Turn off the stream
        When an Observable is done, it emits a complete notification.
        
        You need to know when your Observable completes, otherwise your streams might flood the available memory in your app. If you have a continuous stream, you need to shut it off at some point.
        
        Some observables complete automatically, so there is no need to unsubscribe (but it doesnâ€™t hurt if you do). You can find out if an observable is complete by calling finally(). For example at timer.</p>

<script>
  var interval = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 
  interval
  .finally(() => document.write('All done!'))
  .subscribe(x => document.write(x))
  .unsubscribe()
</script>
