    <p>The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery
        will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</p>

        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Both Google
        and Microsoft host jQuery.

        20. MultiCast - Share values, not side effects
Subjects allow you broadcast values from a shared source, while limiting side effects to only one occurance. You start with a regular Observable, then multicast it to a Subject to be consumed by the end user. This magic happens because a single shared subscription is created to the underlying observable.

  var observable = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');

  var clicks = observable
                    .do(_ => document.write('<br>SIDE EFFECT!!'))

    var subject = clicks.multicast(() => new Rx.Subject() );

    var subA = subject.subscribe( c => document.write(`<br> Sub A: ${c.timeStamp}`))
    var subB = subject.subscribe(c => document.write(`<br> Sub B: ${c.timeStamp}`))

    subject.connect();
